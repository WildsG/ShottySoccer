# [Unity] Shotty-Soccer
## Game originally created on 2018-04 for Ludum Dare 41 (72 hour international game jam).
#### Last opened with Unity Editor version: 2017.4.33f1 ####
<p>Theme of the game jam was "Combine 2 Incompatible Genres". So this is my implementation of the theme.</p>
<p>The game is "fully" finished, but it lacks game balance, better and more thorough controls and many more things.</p>
